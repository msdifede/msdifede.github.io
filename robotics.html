  <h3>Robotics - Connecting an NXT Sensor</h3>
  <p></p>


<h3>The Physical Connection</h3>

<img src="RJ12.jpg" /><p>The HiTechnic sensors are made for connecting to an NXT or EV3 system.  Because 
of this, they have the RJ12 plugs. These plugs are very similar to an ethernet or
phone connection. Additionally, this plug may be very familiar to you if you 
ever progammed Lego robotics. </p>



<p>Connect the breadboard to your robot with Velcro: Cut a small piece of 
velcro to attach to the breadboard and the top of your robot.  This will 
secure the breadboard so we can use it to run the wires. This setup is great 
for getting started quickly, but in a competition, you would want a more secure
sensor connection.</p>


<p>Add a Sensor Mount made from Legos.  On yimagesour robot, there is a Tetrix 
hardpoint connector which allows you to connect lego pieces to the robot.  
Using pegs and beams, create a mount which puts the sensor at the angle and 
position where you think it will get the best readings. Because this is made 
with Legos, you can easily modify it in the future. </p>


<h4>The Electrical Connection</h4>



<p>Since our robot does not have NXT compatible sockets, we need a way to connect
the sensors. We can split open the RJ12 cable and connect the wires directly into 
the Arduino.</p>



<ol>
  <li><b>Cut an NXT Wire in half:</b> Use a wire cutter to cut an NXT wire in half</li>
  
  <li><b>Expose Individual Wires:</b> Using a wire cutter and a wire stripper cut and 
  peel back the black insulating wire to expose the 6 individual color wires.  
  Strip the end of each wire approximately 1/4 inch.</li>
  
  <li><b>Connect the Wire:</b>  You need to connect the individual wire to the ports 
  below.  To connect, you try putting the wire directly into the proto-shield, 
  or solder to additional male wires to get a connection into a breadboard. 
    <ul>
        <li>white : Vin</li>
        <li>black : GND</li>
        <li>red : GND</li>
        <li>green : 3.3V</li>
        <li>yellow : Arduino SCL</li>
        <li>blue : Arduino SDA</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Secure and Label: </b>Make sure all the wires are secure and in the right place in the Arduino 
  and the breadboard. It is a great time to make sure each wire is labeled with
  a small piece of tape.  You can write “Vin Pin1” on the tape, so that if the 
  wire becomes unplugged, you can easily replace it. </li>
